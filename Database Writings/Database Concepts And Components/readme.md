### Database Concepts And Components

Here I have collected all the different database concepts, components, and aspects into one document; formatted into a list of questions with a link to an online resource (which is mostly the Wikipedia article on the subject) covering the subject.

I also provide the links as my intention is to not re-create the answers, as the Wikipedia articles offer a more complete resource then what I can provide. The summary descriptions I have provided are often lifted with minimal changes from Wikipedia articles, vendor documentation, and various internet sites. I did try and find the best summary description to each question to help give the most concise answer possible.

I would like to thank all the individuals who contributed to the Wikipedia articles, created vendor documentation, or blogs for which this document is created from.

Many of these questions make for great interview questions. And some are for finding tidbits of information that you may not have come across in your database studies.
