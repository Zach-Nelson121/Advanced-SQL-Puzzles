### Advanced SQL Puzzles

**https://advancedsqlpuzzles.com**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope you enjoy these puzzles as much as I have enjoyed creating them!

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As my list of puzzles continues to grow, I have decided to combine the puzzles into one single PDF document broken down into two different sections.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first section I have 58 of the most difficult puzzles that I could create; randomly organized and in no specific order.  These are mostly set-based puzzles, interspersed with a small number of puzzles that require knowledge of constraints, specific data types, cursors, loops, etc....

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working through these puzzles will give you an understanding of the SQL language and what types of problems the SQL language best solves.  Remember that SQL is a declarative and not an imperative language, and always think in sets when providing a solution.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second set of puzzles, I have collected all the puzzles related to permutations, combinations, and sequences.  Solving these puzzles will require a deeper knowledge of your SQL thinking, focusing on such constructs as using recursion or sequence objects to reach the desired output (and of course some will require using traditional set-based thinking).  Ultimately these puzzles resolve to creating number tables, which can be used to fill in gaps, create ranges and tallies, provide custom sorting, and allow you to create set based solutions over iterative solutions.  I also included a few puzzles from part 1 into this set as they ultimately deal with creating a numbers table.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope navigating through the GitHub repository to find the solutions is straightforward.  The first set of puzzles are combined into one single SQL script, and the second set has a separate folder with individual solutions, as these solutions are a little more involved in solving.  For my own sanity, it is easiest to not embed the SQL solutions into the document and instead provide them separately as SQL files in the GitHub repository.  If you have any issues navigating the website or the GitHub, please contact me and I would be happy to help.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recentlty I added a folder for all of my scripts that use recursion.  This is a great resource for learning all the diffent puzzles that recursion can solve, and often the best way to learn recursion is to reverse engineer already available scripts.
 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I welcome any corrections, new tricks, new techniques, dead links, misspellings, bugs, and especially any new puzzles that would be a great fit for this document.
Please contact me through the contact page on my website or use the discussion board in the GitHub repository.

:smiley: Happy coding!
