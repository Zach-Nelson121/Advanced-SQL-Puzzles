# Table Validation

This script compares two identical tables using DYNAMIC SQL and FULL OUTER JOINS.  This can be used to audit the differences between two datasets and display all columns which do not match.

## Installation

Inside this GitHub repository you will find the following SQL scripts:

1)  **Table Validation Demo Tables.sql**    
A script that creates the test data for demo purposes. 

2)  **Table Validation Part 1.sql**  
A script that inserts the table information to be audited. 

3)  **Table Validation Part 2.sql**  
A script that creates a dynamic SQL statement and executes. 

To execute a quick demo, execute the above scripts in order. Note, the tables must have the exact same columns for this script to work.  

More instructions coming soon....
