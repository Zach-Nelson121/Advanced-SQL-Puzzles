# Relational Division

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relational division is a relational algebra operation that represents the division of one relation into another relation based on certain conditions. In SQL, relational division can be achieved by using multiple join operations and conditional statements to divide the data in one table into multiple groups based on certain criteria. This can be useful for solving problems such as finding all employees who have had a shift in every department, or employees that have the same licenses or skillsets.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Relational division is not a built-in operator in SQL, so it must be simulated using a combination of other SQL operations, such as joins, subqueries, and conditional statements. The exact implementation of relational division may vary depending on the specific requirements of the problem and the database management system being used.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The simplest way to define relational division is by stating you are looking for a percentage or fraction.  Relational division is used in SQL to select rows that conform to a number of different criteria.
*  I want to find all pilots who can fly 100% of the airplanes in the hanger (the most common example of relational division).
*  I want to find all employees who match on at least two-thirds of their issued licenses.  
*  I want to find all managers who have worked in every department.

Letâ€™s look at a few examples.

--------------------------------------------------------------
#### Planes In The Hanger

The most common example you will find on the internet is the airplanes in the hanger example.

**Pilot Skills**

| Pilot Name |   Plane Name    |
|------------|-----------------|
| Johnson    |  Piper Cub      |
| Williams   |  B-52 Bomber    |
| Williams   |  F-14 Fighter   |
| Williams   |  Piper Cub      |
| Roberts    |  B-52 Bomber    |
| Roberts    |  F-14 Fighter   |
| Jones      |  B-1 Bomber     |
| Jones      |  B-52 Bomber    |
| Jones      |  F-14 Fighter   |
| Brown      |  B-1 Bomber     |
| Brown      |  B-52 Bomber    |
| Brown      |  F-14 Fighter   |
| Brown      |  F-17 Fighter   |

**Hanger**
|  Plane Name  |
|--------------|
| B-1 Bomber   |
| B-52 Bomber  |
| F-14 Fighter |

The query is rather simple once you understand how to use the `HAVING` clause.

```sql
CREATE TABLE #PilotSkills 
(
PilotName VARCHAR(255),
PlaneName VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Johnson', 'Piper Cub');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Williams', 'B-52 Bomber');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Williams', 'F-14 Fighter');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Williams', 'Piper Cub');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Roberts', 'B-52 Bomber');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Roberts', 'F-14 Fighter');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Jones', 'B-1 Bomber');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Jones', 'B-52 Bomber');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Jones', 'F-14 Fighter');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Brown', 'B-1 Bomber');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Brown', 'B-52 Bomber');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Brown', 'F-14 Fighter');
INSERT INTO #PilotSkills (PilotName, PlaneName) VALUES ('Brown', 'F-17 Fighter');

CREATE TABLE #Hangar
(
PlaneName VARCHAR(255)
);

INSERT INTO #Hangar (PlaneName) VALUES ('B-1 Bomber');
INSERT INTO #Hangar (PlaneName) VALUES ('B-52 Bomber');
INSERT INTO #Hangar (PlaneName) VALUES ('F-14 Fighter');

SELECT  ps.PilotName
FROM    #PilotSkills ps,
        #Hangar h
WHERE   ps.PlaneName = h.PlaneName
GROUP BY ps.PilotName 
HAVING  COUNT(ps.PlaneName) = (SELECT COUNT(PlaneName) FROM #Hangar);
```

| Pilot Name |
|------------|
| Brown      |
| Jones      |


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Employees With Matching Licenses.

Another example is find all employees who have the same licenses.

| EmployeeID | License |
|------------|---------|
|       1001 | Class A |
|       1001 | Class B |
|       1001 | Class C |
|       2002 | Class A |
|       2002 | Class B |
|       2002 | Class C |
|       3003 | Class A |
|       3003 | Class D |
|       4004 | Class A |
|       4004 | Class B |
|       4004 | Class D |
|       5005 | Class A |
|       5005 | Class B |
|       5005 | Class D |

```sqlCREATE TABLE #Employees
(
EmployeeID  INTEGER,
License     VARCHAR(100),
PRIMARY KEY (EmployeeID, License)
);

INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES (1001,'Class A');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES (1001,'Class B');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES(1001,'Class C');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES (2002,'Class A');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES (2002,'Class B');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES(2002,'Class C');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES (3003,'Class A');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES(3003,'Class D');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES(4004,'Class A');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES(4004,'Class B');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES(4004,'Class D');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES(5005,'Class A');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES(5005,'Class B');
INSERT INTO #Employees (EmployeeID, License) VALUES(5005,'Class D');

WITH cte_Count AS
(
SELECT  EmployeeID,
        COUNT(*) AS LicenseCount
FROM    #Employees
GROUP BY EmployeeID
),
cte_CountWindow AS
(
SELECT  a.EmployeeID AS EmployeeID_A,
        b.EmployeeID AS EmployeeID_B,
        COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY a.EmployeeID, b.EmployeeID) AS CountWindow
FROM    #Employees a CROSS JOIN
        #Employees b
WHERE   a.EmployeeID <> b.EmployeeID and a.License = b.License
)
SELECT  DISTINCT
        a.EmployeeID_A,
        a.EmployeeID_B,
        a.CountWindow AS LicenseCount
FROM    cte_CountWindow a INNER JOIN
        cte_Count b ON a.CountWindow = b.LicenseCount AND a.EmployeeID_A = b.EmployeeID INNER JOIN
        cte_Count c ON a.CountWindow = c.LicenseCount AND a.EmployeeID_B = c.EmployeeID;
```


| EmployeeID_A | EmployeeID_B | LicenseCount |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
|         1001 |         2002 |            3 |
|         2002 |         1001 |            3 |
|         4004 |         5005 |            3 |
|         5005 |         4004 |            3 |


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### All Departments

The last example shows all employees who have worked in all departments.

**Department History**
| Name  |  Department |  IsActive |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| Chris |  Wardrobe   |         0 |
| Chris |  Lighting   |         1 |
| Chris |  Music      |         0 |
| Nancy |  Wardrobe   |         1 |
| Jim   |  Music      |         1 |
| Jim   |  Wardrobe   |         0 |

```sql
CREATE TABLE #DepartmentHistory
(
Name       VARCHAR(255),
Department VARCHAR(255),
IsActive   INTEGER
);

INSERT INTO #DepartmentHistory (Name, Department, IsActive) VALUES ('Chris', 'Wardrobe', 0);
INSERT INTO #DepartmentHistory (Name, Department, IsActive) VALUES ('Chris', 'Lighting', 1);
INSERT INTO #DepartmentHistory (Name, Department, IsActive) VALUES ('Chris', 'Music', 0);
INSERT INTO #DepartmentHistory (Name, Department, IsActive) VALUES ('Nancy', 'Wardrobe', 1);
INSERT INTO #DepartmentHistory (Name, Department, IsActive) VALUES ('Jim', 'Music', 1);
INSERT INTO #DepartmentHistory (Name, Department, IsActive) VALUES ('Jim', 'Wardrobe', 0);
GO

;WITH cte_DistinctEmployeeDepartment AS
(
SELECT  DISTINCT
        Name,
        Department
FROM    #DepartmentHistory
),
cte_EmployeeDepartmentCount AS
(
SELECT  Name,
        COUNT(Department) AS DepartmentCount
FROM    cte_DistinctEmployeeDepartment
GROUP BY Name
),
cte_DistinctDeparments AS
(
SELECT  COUNT(DISTINCT Department) AS DepartmentCount
FROM    #DepartmentHistory
)
SELECT  *
FROM    cte_EmployeeDepartmentCount
WHERE   DepartmentCount IN (SELECT DepartmentCount from cte_DistinctDeparments);
```

| Name  | DepartmentCount |
|-------|-----------------|
| Chris |               3 |

#### Examples Of What Is Not Relational Division

Sometimes when learning, it is best to understand what does not fit the criteria.

This SQL statement finds the median of a number.  The median is defined as the middle value in a set of data when the values are sorted in ascending or descending order.

The query works by dividing the data into two halves (top 50% and bottom 50%) and then selecting the top 1 value from each of these halves. These two values are then added together and divided by 2 to obtain the median.

While the query does involve dividing the data into two halves, it does not perform a true relational division in the sense that relational division is typically understood in the context of relational databases.

Relational division refers to a set of operations performed on two or more relations (tables) to divide one relation into multiple groups based on certain conditions.

```sql
CREATE TABLE #SampleData
(
IntegerValue  INTEGER NOT NULL
);
GO

INSERT INTO #SampleData VALUES
(5),(6),(10),(10),(13),(14),(17),(20),(81),(90),(76);
GO

--Median
SELECT
        ((SELECT TOP 1 IntegerValue
        FROM    (
                SELECT  TOP 50 PERCENT IntegerValue
                FROM    #SampleData
                ORDER BY IntegerValue
                ) a
        ORDER BY IntegerValue DESC) +  --Add the Two Together
        (SELECT TOP 1 IntegerValue
        FROM (
            SELECT  TOP 50 PERCENT IntegerValue
            FROM    #SampleData
            ORDER BY IntegerValue DESC
            ) a
        ORDER BY IntegerValue ASC)
        ) * 1.0 /2 AS Median;
```

Ranking is also not relational division.  Here is an example finding a percentile on test scores and determining the top 10%.  Relational division refers to a set operation that returns all the tuples in a table that do not have a corresponding tuple in another table, based on certain conditions.  For brieity on this statement, I won't include the test data.

Below is not an example of relational division, but rather a way to divide the scores into percentiles and then select the top 10% of scores based on their value. 

```sql
WITH cte_ScoreData AS 
(
SELECT  Name,
        Score,
        NTILE(100) OVER (ORDER BY Score DESC) AS Percentile
FROM    Scores
)
SELECT  Name,
        Score
FROM   ScoreData
WHERE  Percentile <= 10;
```
