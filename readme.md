# Advanced SQL Puzzles

**https://advancedsqlpuzzles.com**  

This repository contains a collection of my SQL puzzles, tips and tricks, demos, and various writings.  Feel free to rummage around, and I am constantly updating this repository, so check back often.

All SQL is written in **Microsoft SQL Servers TSQL**, unless otherwise noted.

:star: Give this repository a star if you find this repository informative!

## Getting Started

To get started, clone or download the repository to your local machine.  I have included readme files for each directory that describes its contents.  If anything is unclear, please contact me and I would be happy to assist.

## Content
The content of this GitHub is ever growing, here are some of the more popular content:


*  [Advanced SQL Puzzles](/Advanced%20SQL%20Puzzles): A growing collection of my SQL puzzles.  I'm always looking for new puzzles, so please share if you have anything that would be a great fit.  
*  [Recursion](/Advanced%20SQL%20Puzzles/Recursion%20Examples): My collection of SQL queries that use recursion.  Here I solve all sorts of problems such as Markov chains, floor and ceiling caps, Traveling Salesman, and even one for Sudoku.    
*  [Advanced SQL Joins](/Database%20Tips%20and%20Tricks/Advanced%20SQL%20Joins): Ever wanted to know all about semi-joins, anti-joins, equi-joins, theta-joins, self-joins, and all the ways you will encounter the word "join" in your daily SQL activities, then this is the directory for you!    
*  [Behavior of Nulls](/Database%20Tips%20and%20Tricks/Behavior%20Of%20Nulls):  NULL markers are the bane of every developer, so I compiled a list of all the different SQL constructs and how they handle NULL markers.    
*  [Databricks Hive Demo](/Database%20Tips%20and%20Tricks/Databricks%20Hive%20Demo):  Setting up Databricks to connect to an Azure Data Lake and SQL Server is no easy task, so i created an end-to-end demo showing how to set everything up.
