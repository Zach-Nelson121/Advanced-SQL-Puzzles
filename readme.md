# Advanced SQL Puzzles

**https://advancedsqlpuzzles.com**  

This repository contains a collection of my SQL puzzles, tips and tricks, demos, and various writings.  Feel free to rummage around, and I am constantly updating this repository, so check back often.

All SQL is written in Microsoft SQL Servers TSQL, unless otherwise noted.

:star: Please give my repository a star if you like.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone or download the repository to your local machine.  I have included readme files for each directory that describes it's contents.  If anything is unclear, please contact me and I would be happy to assist.  I love talking to other database developers.

## Content
The content of this GitHub is ever growing, here are some of the more popular content:


*  [Advanced SQL Puzzles](/Advanced%20SQL%20Puzzles): A growing collection of SQL puzzles that are on the advanced side.  
*  [Recursion](/Advanced%20SQL%20Puzzles/Recursion%20Examples): My collection of SQL queries that use recursion.  Here I solve all sorts of problems such as Markov chains, floor and ceiling caps, Traveling Salesman, and even one for Sudoku.    
*  [Advanced SQL Joins](): Ever wanted to know all about semi-joins, anti-joins, equi-joins, theta-joins, self-joins, and all the ways you will encounter the word "join" in your daily SQL activities, then this is the directory for you!    
*  [Behavior of Nulls]():  NULL markers are the bane of every developer, so I compiled a list of all the different SQL constructs and how they handle NULL markers.    


## Conclusion
I hope you find this repository to be useful and informative and I welcome any new puzzles or tips and tricks you may have.

I also have a Wordpress site at https:/advancedsqlpuzzles.com where you can find my data analytics projects, Python puzzles, and my blog.
